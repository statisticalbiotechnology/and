Found 215282771 PSMs
Separate target and decoy search inputs detected, using mix-max method.
Train/test set contains 137136136 positives and 78146635 negatives, size ratio=1.75486 and pi0=1
Warning: The mix-max procedure is not well behaved when # targets (137136136) != # decoys (78146635). Consider using target-decoy competition (-Y flag).
