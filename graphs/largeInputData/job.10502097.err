Found 99999999 PSMs
Separate target and decoy search inputs detected, using mix-max method.
Train/test set contains 64484097 positives and 35515902 negatives, size ratio=1.81564 and pi0=1
Warning: The mix-max procedure is not well behaved when # targets (64484097) != # decoys (35515902). Consider using target-decoy competition (-Y flag).
