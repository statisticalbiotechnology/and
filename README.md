#Background

This repository is ment to be a collection of notes from testing the software Percolator. The notes are not ment as a description of the software. Instead these notes will bring up ideas about what could cause issues or be difficult to understand. Unless someone edit this repo, the notes are my own, and made during work hours while working at SciLifeLab as requested by Lukas KÃ¤ll.
